            <p> If you enjoy a moist sweet dessert, the cake option is the best option for you! The term "cake" originated from the ancient Greeks and has lots of history in itself. It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat heavy cake during the Roman period. Then during the Great Depression, cake became known as a mass produced good rtaher than an at home bakery specialty. </p>
            <p> Cakes are divded into many different categories based off their ingredients. Although the different between cake and bread is easy to find, many breads are now considered cakes. For example, banana bread can be considered a quick cake based off its ingredients and technique of production. Also, you have butter cakes, sponge cakes, and many others. With a variety of flavors such as the classic chocolate and vanilla, to the unique lemon curd or red velvet, cake has so many choices just for your taste.</p>
